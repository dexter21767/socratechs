⚠️ **Use an adblocker like uBlock Origin before visiting any of the linked sites.**

Some preliminary [steps to take](https://github.com/dexter21767/socratechs/blob/gh-pages/browsing_and_downloading_guide.md) (in regards to non-software) to avoid accidentally running malware.

See: [Related Subreddits](https://github.com/dexter21767/socratechs/blob/gh-pages/megathread.md/related_subreddits) for streaming subreddits or request subreddits

&nbsp;

❗ ***For hard-to-find content, you can use these [general trackers and/or search for open directories](https://github.com/dexter21767/socratechs/blob/gh-pages/megathread.md/general_sites_and_search_engines). The torrent aggregators and DHT crawlers will be your best bet for finding rare content***

&nbsp; **Download Managers**

> These are useful for DDL sites. Download managers such as these are meant to help to speed up downloads, typically by increasing the number of connections to the server or attempting to split the download into chunks. They are also especially handy when grabbing multiple links at once, which is typical with DDL sites, where they'll split up large downloads into multiple small `.rar` parts, as well as bypassing captchas and eliminating the risks of clicking on the wrong download button on various file hosts. They also help with resuming paused or timed out downloads which your browser may not be able to do in some cases.

* [JDownloader2](http://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) - Download manager that supports downloading from a variety of file-hosts. Supports downloading video from many websites.
* [Internet Download Manager \(IDM\)](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/download.html) - Paid download manager that supports downloading from a variety of file-hosts. Supports downloading video from many websites. Use the free trial, then when the trial is nearing its end, simply reset the trial [with this](https://github.com/J2TEAM/idm-trial-reset). Alternative [method here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/fe8l96/idm_trial_reset_not_working_anymore_what_now/fjmxjdk/).
* [XTREME download manager](https://subhra74.github.io/xdm/) - Another very nice download manager
* [pyLoad](https://pyload.net/) - Lightweight download manager written in python. Managed through a WEB UI.
* [aria2](https://aria2.github.io/) - Commandline-based download utility.

### ► **Private Torrent Trackers**

[Introduction to private trackers](https://github.com/dexter21767/socratechs/blob/gh-pages/guides/private_trackers.md)

* [PassThePopcorn (PTP)](https://passthepopcorn.me/) - Movies tracker. Best source for movies, period. Couple of unique features - 
!!!!* The amount of active fleshed out collections available to discover content to watch. It's often better than some legit sites dedicated to this stuff.  
!!!!* High quality encodes. Many torrents are marked Golden Popcorn (GP). They are best of the best encodes. It is like Oscars but for encodes.  
Currently it is not possible to join PTP unless you know someone who has an account there and can invite you. The best strategy suggested is to reach as high of a user class you can reach on RED as feasibly possible. This will increase chances when PTP starts recruiting again. In the meantime you can join SC, BHD, BLU etc and make requests there

* [HD-Torrents (HDT)](https://hdts.ru/) - Movies/TV tracker. Focuses on HD content only. This tracker is great for HD movies though not as good as PTP. Specialty lies in allowing of multiple untouched material of the same movie, which helps in getting those foreign languages, different audio/video quality, or even different content in audio/videos. Slightly superior to PTP in this regard. Can be joined through RED or you can just pay for an account through their website. (Note - Only buy the account from their own website, not a 3rd party)

* [pixelhd.me](https://pixelhd.me/) - Movies tracker. Known for producing small sized encodes. `PxHD Mobies` - 720p/AAC/mp4 at 1.5-2GB (esp. for Mobile Devices); `PxHD/PxEHD` - 1080p/AC3/mp4 at 4GB and 8GB; and `PxHDA` - 1080p/DTS/ at "whatever size is necessary" for high transparency (usually 6-12gb).

* [uhdbits.org](https://uhdbits.org/) - Movies tracker. Produces small-sized "micro-HD" encodes. Gives annoying tests to members to keep accounts.

* [beyond-hd.me](https://beyond-hd.me/) - Movies/TV tracker. Focuses on HD content only. Home of the famous FRaMeSToR remux group.

* [TV Chaos UK](https://tvchaosuk.com) - TV tracker. Great site for UK TV content. Best joined through requesting on /r/invites (proof of ratio from other sites required). Quality lacks a bit so use it with a TV tracker like BTN to get the most of UK content

* [Broadcast the Net (BTN)](http://broadcasthe.net/) - TV tracker. Best source for TV related content, period. Currently this tracker is not recruiting anywhere but it is recommended to join PTP where BTN will recruit again in the future

* [TV Vault (TVV)](https://tv-vault.me/) - TV tracker. Best private tracker for old TV shows. Best way to join it is through MAM.
