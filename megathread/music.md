* [Chimera](https://github.com/CedArctic/Chimera) - Supports downloading music from multiple platforms.

* [Soulseek](http://www.slsknet.org/news/node/1) - Desktop app that connects you to a P2P network used for downloading music (any format). Unlike bittorrent, the protocol used here is direct P2P i.e. downloading and uploading is not done with multiple users simultaneously but with a single user (like downloading a file from a website). This provides more security than public trackers as there is no swarm for copyright trolls to stay in and monitor. Though there is no quality control here, the chances of encountering low quality files is still quite low. For people wanting to share their libraries, soulseek is the easiest and fastest way.

* [Redacted.ch](https://redacted.ch/) - Aka RED. FLAC, mp3, m4a. Best music private tracker. One of the harder trackers to maintain ratio on. 

* [Orpheus.network](https://orpheus.network/) -  Aka OPS. FLAC, mp3, m4a. Second best music private tracker, after RED. Much easier ratio economy compared to RED. In addition, there is a thread where you can request any torrent available on RED, without putting a request. This provides full access to RED without the hard economy. It is highly beneficial to have accounts on both trackers.
